# SHA-256 Algorithm(python implementation)


 
## Introduction

**SHA-256** is a hash function that can process a message
to produce a condensed representation called a message digest. These algorithms enable the
determination of a messageâ€™s integrity: any change to the message will, with a very high
probability, result in a different message digest. This property is useful in the generation and
verification of digital signatures and message authentication codes, and in the generation of
random numbers (bits).[1]

## Implementation

To implement this program there were follow different resources like [secure hash standar](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/fips/180-2/final/docs/fips180-2.pdf)
and this [website]("https://sha256algorithm.com/").
